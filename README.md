## What is linear Regression?
## Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous numerical value based on the relationship between input (independent)     variables and an output (dependent) variable.

## Linear regression finds the best-fitting straight line (also called a regression line) through a set of data points to predict a target value.
