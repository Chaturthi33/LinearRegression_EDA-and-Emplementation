## Health Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression

### ðŸ“˜ Overview

##### This project aims to analyze and predict medical insurance costs based on key factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region.
##### By using Linear Regression, we explore how each factor affects healthcare expenses and build a model to estimate future costs for individuals.
